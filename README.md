# sample-scala
This repositories contains two examples of Scala scanning with 
[Fortify SCA](https://www.microfocus.com/en-us/cyberres/application-security/static-code-analyzer).

- Folder "scala-maven" contains an example of Scala scanning on a Scala project built with Maven.
- Folder "scala-gradle" contains an example of Scala scanning on a Scala project built with Gradle.

Each folder has its own README.md with detailed explanation.

Full documentation of this functionality can be found on the [scala-fortify plugin](https://developer.lightbend.com/docs/fortify/current/) page.
